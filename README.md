# Quantulator
This is just a little simulation of the basic principles of a quantum computer.
It is neither intended to be as efficient nor as versatile as possible. Just a project of a student who wants to understand the underlying principles.

The goal is to do as much as possible from scratch, only using packages when I *really* can't be bothered to do it myself.

For performance reason and because I like it, I will use the Julia language, which offers nice built in support for fast, vectorized operations.
The main code will just be located in plain Julia code, with interfaces in Jupyter or Pluto notebooks (not sure what to use yet)
